# How to contibute to YetiForce?

First of all - THANK YOU‚ù§ for taking the time to contribute to our project. We appreciate your effort and willingness to help us make YetiForce even better.
If you want to contribute to YetiForce even if  have no (or little) programming knowledge don‚Äôt worry, you can still help us out big time! Here‚Äôs how:

## üëçTRANSLATE the system
We are always looking for people who would like to help us translate YetiForce to different languages in order to be able to reach people all over the world. We as a company only take care of the English and Polish translations of the system, all the other languages are maintained by our wonderful community. 
Adding and updating translations in YetiForce is very simple and doesn‚Äôt require any programming knowledge thanks to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/yetiforcecrm). This [guide](https://yetiforce.com/en/knowledge-base/documentation/implementer-documentation/item/adding-translations-via-crowdin) explains how to add new translations.

## üëçTEST the system
Help us find all the bugs in the developer version of our system - [gitdeveloper](https://gitdeveloper.yetiforce.com). We add changes to the this version several times per day and sometimes some bugs manage to sneak in as well, so testers are always most welcome and appreciated. Once you do find a bug you should definitely ‚Üì

## üëçREPORT issues
We can only fix the issues that we know of, so whenever you spot a bug, please let us know. If you find a bug on your own instance, please test whether it also exists on our [testing version](https://gitdeveloper.yetiforce.com/).  We prepared several different issue templates for you to choose depending on what you want to report. The templates will guide you through the reporting process so please fill them in carefully and give us as much information as possible. Issues that don't provide enough information and can't be reproduced will be closed. Additionally, before you submit an issue, search the open and closed tickets at GitHub. Someone might have already reported this or a similar problem, so you will have a ready solution.

IMPORTANT: Please report only one problem in one issue, it makes it easier for us to keep track of all the issues we still need to fix. Thank you!
